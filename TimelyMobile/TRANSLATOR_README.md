### Translation Service
The app uses a translation service (`lib/translationService.ts`) that supports:

- **LibreTranslate API**: Free, open-source translation API
- **Extensible**: Easy to switch to Google Translate, DeepL, or other APIs

### Dependencies Required
```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
```

The following dependencies are already included in the project:
- `expo-haptics`: For haptic feedback
- `@expo/vector-icons`: For icons
- `react-native`: Core React Native components

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd TimelyMobile
   npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
   ```

2. **Add Translator to Event**:
   - In the desktop app, go to Event Dashboard
   - Drag the "Translator" add-on to the active modules
   - Save the add-ons

3. **Access in Mobile App**:
   - Open the Timely mobile app
   - Navigate to the "Apps" tab
   - Tap on the Translator app card
   - Start translating!

## API Integration

### Current Implementation
- Uses mock translations for development
- Includes LibreTranslate API integration for production
- Easy to switch to other translation services

### To Use Real Translation API
1. **Google Translate API**:
   ```typescript
   // In translationService.ts, replace the API call with:
   const response = await fetch('https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${GOOGLE_API_KEY}`,
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       q: text,
       source: sourceLanguage,
       target: targetLanguage,
     }),
   });
   ```

2. **DeepL API**:
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch('https://api-free.deepl.com/v2/translate', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `DeepL-Auth-Key ${DEEPL_API_KEY}`,
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       text: [text],
       source_lang: sourceLanguage.toUpperCase(),
       target_lang: targetLanguage.toUpperCase(),
     }),
   });
   ```
