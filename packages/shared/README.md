# Shared Package

This package contains shared business logic, TypeScript types, and (optionally) UI components for use in both the Electron (React) and React Native apps.

- Place shared types in `types/`
- Place shared utilities in `utils/`
- Place cross-platform UI components in `components/` (if using a compatible library)
