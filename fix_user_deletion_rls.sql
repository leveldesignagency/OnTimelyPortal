-- ============================================
-- FIX USER DELETION FROM GROUPS - RLS POLICY FIX
-- ============================================
-- This fixes the issue where users can't be deleted from groups due to RLS policies

-- Check current RLS status
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'chat_participants';

-- Check existing policies on chat_participants
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  policyname, 
  permissive, 
  roles, 
  cmd, 
  qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'chat_participants';

-- SOLUTION 1: Temporarily disable RLS on chat_participants to test
-- (This will confirm if RLS is the issue)
ALTER TABLE chat_participants DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- SOLUTION 2: If you want to keep RLS enabled, create a permissive DELETE policy
-- (Only run this after testing Solution 1)
-- 
-- First, drop any existing restrictive policies
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company users can access their chat participants" ON chat_participants;
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only see participants of their chats" ON chat_participants;
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all chat participant operations" ON chat_participants;
-- 
-- Then create a new policy that allows group admins to delete users
-- CREATE POLICY "Group admins can manage participants" ON chat_participants
--   FOR ALL USING (
--     -- Allow all operations for now (your app handles the security)
--     true
--   );
-- 
-- Re-enable RLS with the new policy
-- ALTER TABLE chat_participants ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test the fix
