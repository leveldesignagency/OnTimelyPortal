-- ============================================
-- EMERGENCY FIX: TEAM CHAT CREATION ISSUE
-- ============================================
-- This fixes the "Failed to create team chat - null response" error
-- by disabling problematic RLS policies that conflict with custom auth

-- Step 1: Disable RLS on chat-related tables to allow team chat creation
ALTER TABLE chats DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE chat_participants DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE teams DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE team_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE messages DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE message_reactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Drop all existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only see chats they participate in" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only see participants of their chats" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only see messages from their chats" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only see reactions on accessible messages" ON message_reactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company isolation for chats" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company isolation for chat_participants" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company isolation for messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company isolation for message_reactions" ON message_reactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access company chats" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access company chat participants" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access company teams" ON teams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access company team members" ON team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all chat operations" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all chat participant operations" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all team operations" ON teams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all team member operations" ON team_members;

-- Step 3: Verify tables are accessible
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('chats', 'chat_participants', 'teams', 'team_members', 'messages', 'message_reactions')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Step 4: Success message
