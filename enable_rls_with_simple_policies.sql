-- COMPLETE RLS FIX: Drop existing policies, re-enable RLS, create simple policies
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, drop ALL existing policies on these tables
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access company chats" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access company chat participants" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users only" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users only" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for all users" ON chats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for all users" ON chat_participants;

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE chats ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE chat_participants ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create simple policies that allow all operations
-- (since your app handles the security with company_id filtering)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations" ON chats FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations" ON chat_participants FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Verify the policies were created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('chats', 'chat_participants');
