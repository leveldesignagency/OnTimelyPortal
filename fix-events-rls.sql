-- TEMPORARY FIX: Disable RLS on events table until authentication is properly set up
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix create event functionality

-- Drop the problematic RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view events from their company" ON events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert events for their company" ON events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update events from their company" ON events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete events from their company" ON events;

-- Temporarily disable RLS (we'll re-enable it later when auth is working)
ALTER TABLE events DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a simple policy that allows all operations for now
ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on events" ON events FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Test that it works
SELECT 'Events table is ready' as status;
