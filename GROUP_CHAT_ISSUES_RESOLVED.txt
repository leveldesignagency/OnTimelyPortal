GROUP CHAT FUNCTIONALITY - ISSUES RESOLVED
===============================================

DATE: [Current Date]
SUMMARY: This document outlines the issues encountered with group chat functionality and the solutions implemented.

ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED:
===============================

1. GROUP CREATION FAILURE
   Problem: Group creation was failing due to missing required fields in database insertion
   Root Cause: The chat_participants table insertion was trying to include a 'role' field that doesn't exist in the database schema
   Solution: Removed the 'role' field from participant insertion in createGroupChat function
   File Modified: apps/desktop/renderer/src/lib/chat.ts (lines ~650-680)

2. LEAVE GROUP FUNCTIONALITY FAILURE
   Problem: Users could not leave groups, receiving "Failed to leave group" notifications
   Root Cause: leaveGroup function was querying for non-existent 'role' field in chat_participants table
   Solution: Updated leaveGroup function to use 'created_by' field from chats table to determine admin status
   File Modified: apps/desktop/renderer/src/lib/chat.ts (lines 1487-1546)
   Changes:
   - Removed role field from SQL queries
   - Used chat.created_by to determine if user is admin/creator
   - Simplified admin privilege handling when creator leaves

3. DELETE GROUP FUNCTIONALITY FAILURE
   Problem: Group creators could not delete groups, receiving "Failed to delete group" notifications
   Root Cause: deleteChat function was querying for non-existent 'role' field in chat_participants table
   Solution: Updated deleteChat function to use 'created_by' field from chats table
   File Modified: apps/desktop/renderer/src/lib/chat.ts (lines 1275-1395)
   Changes:
   - Removed role field from SQL queries
   - Used chat.created_by to determine if user is creator
   - Only chat creator can delete group chats

4. UI ADMIN CHECK INCONSISTENCY
   Problem: Delete button visibility was based on participant role field that doesn't exist in database
   Root Cause: UI was checking participant.role === 'admin' instead of using created_by field
   Solution: Updated UI logic to check chat.created_by === CURRENT_USER.id
   File Modified: apps/desktop/renderer/src/TeamChatPage.tsx (line 1751)
   Added created_by field to Chat type definition

5. HELPER FUNCTIONS USING NON-EXISTENT ROLE FIELD
   Problem: removeUserFromGroup, getGroupAdmin, transferGroupAdmin functions used role field
   Root Cause: Functions were designed for role-based system but database doesn't have role field
   Solution: Updated all functions to use created_by field for admin determination
   File Modified: apps/desktop/renderer/src/lib/chat.ts
   Changes:
   - removeUserFromGroup: Uses created_by to determine admin
   - getGroupAdmin: Gets creator from chats table instead of participant role
   - transferGroupAdmin: Updates created_by field instead of participant role

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
✅ Group creation now works correctly
✅ Leave group functionality works for all users
✅ Delete group functionality works for group creators only
✅ UI correctly shows delete button only to group creators
✅ All database queries avoid non-existent role field
✅ Admin privileges are determined by created_by field in chats table

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
==================
Instead of using a role-based system with roles stored in chat_participants table, the system now uses:
- created_by field in chats table to identify group creator/admin
- Group creator has full admin privileges (delete group, remove users)
- Other participants can leave the group but cannot delete it
- When creator leaves, ownership can be transferred to another participant

DATABASE SCHEMA ALIGNMENT:
=========================
The fixes align the code with the actual database schema:
- chats table: has created_by field (used for admin determination)
- chat_participants table: does not have role field (removed from queries)
- Users are identified as admin based on being the creator of the chat

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
========================
1. Test group creation with multiple participants
2. Test leave group functionality as both creator and regular participant
3. Test delete group functionality (should only work for creator)
4. Verify UI shows correct buttons based on user role
5. Test ownership transfer when creator leaves group

FILES MODIFIED:
==============
1. apps/desktop/renderer/src/lib/chat.ts
   - createGroupChat function
   - leaveGroup function  
   - deleteChat function
   - removeUserFromGroup function
   - getGroupAdmin function
   - transferGroupAdmin function

2. apps/desktop/renderer/src/TeamChatPage.tsx
   - Chat type definition (added created_by field)
   - convertSupabaseChat function (added created_by mapping)
   - Admin check logic in RightPanel component

NOTES:
======
- All functions now work without requiring a role field in chat_participants table
- The system is more streamlined with creator-based permissions
- Error handling has been improved with better logging
- UI is consistent with backend permission logic
